		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
		
		<p><b>Picture Password Lockscreen Android Application: </b><br />
		The application allows users to unlock their phones by drawing gestures such as points, lines, and circles on user chosen images. It is much more secure than traditional passwords as there are effectively an infinite number of combinations. Since the application was submitted to the Android market in September 2012, it has been downloaded close to a million times. </p>

		<p><b>Encrypted DashCam Android Application: </b><br />
		This application enables any Android device with a camera to act as a dashcam for use inside motor vehicles. It goes one step further than most other dashcam applications by encrypting all recorded video footage and therefore securing your privacy. In the event of a vehicle break-in, the thief cannot view the recorded footage without the correct password. </p>

		Provides extended support and updates to numerous Motorola and HTC smartphones that have reached their official end of life by enhancing the Android Open Source Project source code. </p>

		Developed an infrastructure that ties several platforms together (DSC security system, Amazon Echo, Sonos speakers, internet connected remotes etc.) to create a seamless and complete smart home experience where any internet connected electronic device can be controlled from anywhere by voice or touch. </p>
